Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

For each of the first three faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insertPath()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_newNode()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_unlinkParentToChild()
===============================================================

For bdtBad4, you do not have to find the bug. Instead, indicate what
is different about trying to debug this executable in gdb versus the
other three:

      Unlike for the other three modules, every time we run bdtBad4
      in the shell, we get different garbage results, because the
      shell separates different parts of memory for the program (as
      though it was not deterministic. But when we run it in gdb,
      we always get the same output (because gdb uses the same location
      in memory).

      Incidentally, the bug is located in BDT_toString(), where result
      is malloc'ed but not initialized.



For bdtBad5, you do not have to find the bug. Instead, indicate one
hypothesis for how the program could crash within the DynArray module,
which we promise is itself correct:

      If DynArray is correct, the only way the program could crash
      within it is if the client violates the contract, sending
      wrong parameters to DynArray (which, in fact, is what happens).

      The bug is in BDT_toString, where DynArray_new is built with
      count + 1 as argument instead of just count.

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
